Week 2 Project: Shark Attacks
Team: BackStreetBoys (Nancy, Benoit, Diego, Aru)

Business Case:
Lifeguards in Florida are facing a rising number of shark attacks. Our goal is to provide data-driven insights and actionable recommendations to help reduce incidents and improve response.

Objectives:
We investigated potential correlations between shark attacks and various factors, including:

Season
Time of day
Water activities
Exact location along the coastline
We also compiled summary statistics on common injuries to help lifeguards be better prepared.

Analysis:
We conducted cross-sectional analyses to explore:

Time of day vs. Season
Activity type vs. Injuries

Data Cleaning:
Before analysis, we filtered and cleaned the data, focusing on:

Florida-specific data
Removing irrelevant variables
Categorizing dates into seasons
Categorizing time into time of the day
Grouping activities into 5 main categories
Identifying 20 key beaches
Classifying injuries into 9 main types
Key Findings:

Peak Season: Summer
Peak Time of Day: Afternoon
Common Activity: Surfing
Top Beach for Attacks: New Smyrna Beach
Most Common Injury: Laceration
Recommendations:

Increase lifeguard staffing during and in summer and autumn.
Allocate more lifeguard during afternoons.
Allocate more resources to New Smyrna Beach.
Pay special attention to surfers.
Ensure lifeguards are equipped to treat lacerations effectively.
